# PreSonus Quantum 2626 Linux driver

Experimental out-of-tree ALSA PCI driver for the PreSonus Quantum 2626
Thunderbolt interface (`1c67:0104`). The project is based on static protocol
recovery from the macOS DriverKit extension and bounded tests on owned hardware.

## Linux audio works

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The Quantum 2626 is producing real audio on Linux.** The current driver

This is no longer a fake-pointer or register-probing proof of concept. The
driver uses the recovered TCI mailbox, hardware DMA page tables, real audio
interrupts, and the hardware position counter. The result has been heard
through the interface's headphone output and exercised through both direct
ALSA and normal desktop applications.

### What works today

- The recovered TCI mailbox reaches the device-ready state; the interface's
  indicator is solid blue after the Linux handshake.
- Direct ALSA playback is stable in the proven 48 kHz, 26-channel, S32_LE,
  128-frame-period configuration.
- Playback channels 1 and 2 are physically confirmed through the left and
  right headphone outputs.
- Ordinary YouTube audio plays through the Quantum PipeWire sink and is
  physically audible through the connected headphones.
- The bundled ALSA UCM profile exposes Main plus every 48 kHz output pair over
  a shared multichannel stream. WirePlumber publishes all 13 named playback
  sinks.
- A 26-channel capture PCM is live-proven through direct ALSA and concurrent
  PipeWire playback/capture. UCM publishes all 26 Mic/Line/S/PDIF/ADAT inputs
  as independent mono sources—including a standalone, live-tested Line Input
  5 instead of a forced 5/6 stereo pair.
- Playback and capture run concurrently through the shared hardware engine;
  bounded duplex tests completed without an xrun, DMA timeout, or stop failure.

The current live-proven contract remains fixed at 48 kHz. The repository source
now implements native 44.1, 48, 88.2, 96, 176.4, and 192 kHz selection with the
recovered 26/18/8-channel profiles, but that new clock-changing path has passed
only offline build and static checks. Other analog outputs, physical S/PDIF/ADAT
paths, and every non-48 kHz profile still need bounded hardware validation.

The canonical evidence and current limitations are in
[`notes/CURRENT_STATUS.md`](notes/CURRENT_STATUS.md). The exact channel layout
is in [`notes/CHANNEL_ROUTING.md`](notes/CHANNEL_ROUTING.md).

## Build

```bash
make -C driver
```

The build requires headers for the running kernel. Compilation proves source
compatibility only; it does not prove a hardware path safe.

## Install

From `driver/`, the install target places both the kernel module and the ALSA
UCM desktop profile:

```bash
cd driver
sudo make install
sudo modprobe snd-quantum2626
```

Module load/unload, audio-service changes, playback, capture, and hardware
probing are live tests. Follow
[`docs/agents/hardware-testing.md`](docs/agents/hardware-testing.md) and
establish a fresh test boundary before running them.

## Known limits

- Only the Quantum 2626 PCI ID is enabled; related Quantum models are not
  claimed or probed by this driver.
- The tracked UCM desktop profile remains fixed to the live-proven 48 kHz,
  26-channel layout. Direct ALSA/DAW use of the new native-rate source requires
  the matching full raw frame: 26 channels at 44.1/48, 18 at 88.2/96, and 8 at
  176.4/192 kHz.
- No mixer controls, MIDI, live-proven high-rate profile, or hot-removal proof
  exists yet.
- End-to-end latency and release-performance tuning are not complete; no sub-millisecond or
  professional real-time performance claim is made yet.
- Capture is live-proven at 48 kHz through direct ALSA and PipeWire duplex tests.
- ADAT routing is statically identified, not physically confirmed on Linux.

This repository contains no proprietary driver binary or bulk decompiler
output. Local reverse-engineering artifacts are intentionally ignored.
